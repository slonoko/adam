## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- `uv` package manager
- Environment variables configured
- MCP server running (provides tools to agents)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Install uv package manager (if not already installed):**
   ```bash
   pip install uv
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   uv install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   - Copy the example environment file:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   - Configure required API keys and model settings in `.env`:
     ```env
     # Google Cloud Configuration
     GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your_google_cloud_project_id
     GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1
     GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=False

     # Google API Key for Gemini models
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here

     # AI Model to use for agents
     MODEL_NAME=gemini-2.5-flash

     # MCP Server URL (where the MCP tools server is running)
     mcp_server_url=http://localhost:8080
     ```

## üö¶ Running the Agents

### Running Individual Agents

Each agent can be run independently using the Google ADK framework:

```bash
# Run the multi-agent coordinator
adk run clocknstock

# Or run individual agents
adk run stockwhisperer
adk run cashanova
adk run dailydrip
adk run timekeeper
adk run drawer
adk run freshnews
adk run tradingguru
```

### Web Interface

Launch the web interface for interactive access:

```bash
adk web
```

### API Server

Run as a server for programmatic access:

```bash
adk api_server
```

> **Note**: These agents require the MCP server to be running to access their tools. Each agent connects to specific MCP endpoints for their functionality.

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

The agents can be containerized and deployed using Docker configurations available in the parent project.
